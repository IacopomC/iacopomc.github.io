Currently enrolled in an international Master's Degree (["Imaging and Light in Extended Reality", IMLEX](https://imlex.org/)), I hold a Bachelor of Science in Physics and I have past experience in Web Development and Data Science. Fascinated by the way new technologies are shaping the world, from data science to automotive vehicles, from electrical cars to solar energy, driven by my passion for knowledge I’m avidly satisfying my interests through MOOCs.
<br/>
Complementing my passions, 15 years of scouting experience - 5 of which as leader - have shaped my ability to work with and lead groups. Ability that I’m willing to use to gain hands-on experience and be part of this new technological revolution.
