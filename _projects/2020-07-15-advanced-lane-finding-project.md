In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.

<br/>

Discover more advanced computer vision techniques, like distortion correction and gradient thresholding, to improve upon your lane lines algorithm!

<br/>

Youâ€™ll start with calibrating cameras and manipulating images, and end by applying support vector machines and decision trees to extract information from video.

<br/>

The tools used are:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
