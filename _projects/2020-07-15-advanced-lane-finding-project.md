In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.

<br/>

Discover more advanced computer vision techniques, like distortion correction and gradient thresholding, to improve upon your lane lines algorithm!

<br/>

Youâ€™ll start with calibrating cameras and manipulating images, and end by applying support vector machines and decision trees to extract information from video.
