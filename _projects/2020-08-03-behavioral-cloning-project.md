The goal of this project is to use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior.

The steps followed are:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road

The project is developed using Python and Keras. You can download the full code from [GitHub](https://github.com/IacopomC/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3).
