I'm an XR grad student part of the (["Imaging and Light in Extended Reality", IMLEX](https://imlex.org/){:target="_blank"}) program with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and past experience in Web Development and Data Science. My research interests lie at the intersection between computer vision and robotics, focusing on probabilistic techniques for SLAM, localization, place recognition, perception, and navigation. This involves developing and applying state estimation, machine and deep learning algorithms for robots and sensor data interpretation.
<br/>
Complementing my passions, 15 years of scouting experience - 5 of which as leader - have shaped my ability to work with and lead groups. Ability that Iâ€™m willing to use to gain hands-on experience and be part of this new technological revolution.
