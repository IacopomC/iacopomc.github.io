The purpose of this post is to explain the theory behind the project [Advanced Lane Finding](https://iacopomc.github.io/projects/2020-07-15-advanced-lane-finding-project/) and build up some intuition about the process. There won't be any snippet from the source code since we only want to build a high level understanding of why we do what we do.
