The purpose of this post is to explain the theory behind the project [Traffic Sign Classifier](https://iacopomc.github.io/projects/2020-07-25-traffic-sign-classifier-project/) and build up some intuition about the process. There won't be any snippets from the source code since we only want to build a high level understanding of why we do what we do.

<br/>

Deep learning has become the most important frontier in both machine learning and autonomous vehicle development. In this project, we'll train a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs.
